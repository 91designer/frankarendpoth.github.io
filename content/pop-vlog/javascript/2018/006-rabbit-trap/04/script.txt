Hey, Guys, my name is Frank and THIS is the Poth on Programming Video Log - Part
4 of how to make a tile based platformer in PURE HTML5 & JavaScript! In today's
video I'm going to show YOU!!! The aspiring game programmer, how to add pixel perfect,
professional quality, tile based collision detection and response to a platforming game.
So stay tuned to find out how it's done!

BULLETS

a. Part 4 changes
  - Tile collision and that's pretty much it.
  - show game and display files

b. How it's done
  - collision tiles are stored in a map
  - the collision function reads the map under the player
  - the routing function finds the appropriate collision methods for the tile,
  - the collision methods move the player out of collision.

c. The collision function
  - how to get the tile under player from the map

d. The routing function
  - It's just one big switch statement that takes tile values from the map

e. The collision methods
  - They resolve collision between the player and tile

IN THIS VIDEO I'm going to talk about what's changed since part 3. Then I'm going
to go over the three main components of my collision system. There's the Broad Phase,
the routing function, and the narrow phase.

If you have any comments or questions, put them in the comments section, and if you
learn something, like this video so others can find it as well. Now let's get into
this video!

CONCLUSION

In this video I talked about how to implement tile based collision detection
and response. You can find the working example and source code linked in the
video description. As always, feel free to hit me up in the comments below,
