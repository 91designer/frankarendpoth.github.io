Hey, guys, my name is Frank and THIS is the Poth on Programming Video Log.

Today I'm covering Part 2 of how to make a tile based platforming game using pure
HTML5 and JavaScript! Today's video is going to be on adding a player object to
the screen and controlling him with the keyboard. This is a vital component of any
game, so stay tuned to find out how it's done!



IN THIS VIDEO, I'm going to talk about the example program, what it does, and how
the program has changed since part 1. Then I'm going to show you the specific code
that handles creating the player, controlling him, and drawing everything to the screen.
Finally, I'm going to show you my implementation of a fixed time step game loop and
how it works.

If you have any comments or questions, POST 'EM! And if at any point while you're
watching this video you get the sensation that you're learning, be sure to support

Conclusion

In this video I showed you how to lay the groundwork for any platforming game.
So far I've implemented keyboard input, simple platforming physics, scaling for
multiple devices, and a fixed time step game loop to handle updating your game at
a consistent rate no matter what device it's on, which is perhaps the most important
thing you can take away from this video.

If you want to learn more about this example, check out the source code and working
example that I have linked in the video description, and if you want to see more,
subscribe to my channel and I'll keep the code coming. Until then, thanks for watching
and have a good one!
