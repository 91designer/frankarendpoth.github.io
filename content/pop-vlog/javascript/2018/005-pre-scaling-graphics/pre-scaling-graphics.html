    <p>This application creates an array of graphics scaled up from their original
       size every time the screen is resized. This eliminates the need to scale
       on future redraws. If I redrew the screen at 60fps, I would avoid scaling
       60 times per second! That's a huge performance gain! In addition, by storing
       each tile graphic in its own canvas element, I eliminate texture bleeding
       upon scaling the image. Texture bleeding occurs when an image is scaled and
       a pixel needs to be colored based on its neighbors. In a tile sheet, you
       don't want colors from one tile image bleeding into a neighboring tile image.
       In addition, this approach eliminates the chance of poor edge reconciliation
       due to rounding errors and/or antialiasing at tile edges giving the appearance
       of "gutters" or borders between tiles that should not be there.</p>
