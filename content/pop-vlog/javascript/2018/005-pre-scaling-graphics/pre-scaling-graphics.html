    <p>Scaling graphics can sometimes cause antialiasing and rounding errors. The
    key to avoiding these issues is to ensure that your scaled graphics are scaled
    to a whole number that can be divided by the scale factor to get the original
    size of the graphic. This application uses these principles to create scaled
    graphics that are drawn seamlessly to the display canvas. Each scaled graphic
    is stored in its own canvas object for later use, making redraws at the same
    scale much faster. When the screen is resized, all the graphics are redrawn to
    the new scale factor. If texture bleeding becomes an issue, draw each graphic
    to an individual canvas element without scaling, then draw that canvas to the
    final scaled canvas. From what I can tell, there is no texture bleeding in this
    example. Scaling is handled by the CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawImage method.</p>
